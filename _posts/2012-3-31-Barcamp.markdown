<p>Made the journey up to Portland for my first <a href="http://barcampportland.org/">Barcamp</a>. Joined by a couple of buddies from the KMUZ, we arrived to witness the scheduling process. I decided to just observe this time, but Nate pitched a session. It was a very interesting process.</p>

<p>
	<h3>First Session</h3>
	<p>
		My first session of the morning was lead by a contributor to the linux kernel. Lot's deep CS discussion.
	</p>

	<h3>Second Session</h3>
	<p>Next, I participated in a discussion on bug data and some of the issues created from user input. </p>
	
	<h3>Lunch</h3>
	<p>We grabbed lunch at a great middle-eastern deli called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/all-spice-deli-portland">All Spice Deli</a>. 
	<h3>Third Session</h3>
	<p>This session focused on testing/UX testing. Learned a lot about <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_testing">boundary testing</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_partitioning">Equivalence partitioning</a> and other testing procdures
