<p>
I followed <a href="http://erjjones.github.com/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/" target="_blank">this simple tutorial</a> to create a nice looking blog hosted on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>. It was pretty straight forward.

  One key component left out is -- you need to edit the rake file to create your posts. This is not done in his example, unless I am missing something. Overall though, its a well thought out article. I would not recommend this method for those of you who cannot write HTML or are scared off by simple Ruby syntax. I like that I can tweak and script the site. I think I am going to have a bit of fun with this.
